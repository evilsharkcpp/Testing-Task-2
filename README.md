# Testing Task 2

 Find axes of symmetry for polygon(closed polyline).
 Code for MSVC on Windows.
 This variant is improvement for this project(https://github.com/evilsharkcpp/Testing-Task).
 It solve a problem to compare 2 polygons with O(N^2) to O(N). And now this project can find all
 axes of symmetry faster than old variant.
